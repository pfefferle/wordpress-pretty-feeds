This plugin is inspired by [Dave Ruperts Feed](https://daverupert.com/atom.xml) and is based on his and this XSL file: https://github.com/genmon/aboutfeeds/blob/main/tools/pretty-feed-v3.xsl

Thanks to @Dan-Q (see [his feed](https://danq.me/feed/)) for [motivating me](https://danq.me/2023/07/28/better-wordpress-rss-feeds/) to finally make a plugin out of my plans from [three years ago](https://github.com/pfefferle/autonomie/commit/a53359af3b7253781b471023dad88a08cb4f24c7)!
